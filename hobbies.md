My Hobbies

* Dance:
"It can be said, "dance is a kind of artistic expression, which is based on the principle of aesthetics and body movement as the medium." ... The movement of the body is in the thoughts and feelings under the control of rhythm and sense of purpose and organization movement."-Zegang Chen "

* Photography:
"In general, photography as a hobby can be a great source of comfort, especially if you do it on your own. For example, going for a walk to take landscape photos will expose you to fresh air and help you connect with nature. Going out to take photos with friends will let you socialise and be creative at the same time."http:// exportphotography.com"
