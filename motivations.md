Career Changing

what is motivating me to change my career are 3 things:

1. Today everyone is using some kind of web development tool to do their business, no matter what business it is.

2. There are very little number of woman int his area, i know I can do it, and I think as a woman, in this time,  it is very important to be part of this change in history.

3. I honestly think the whole future is on web. Just like in the past happened with "Metal" , "Machines" , "industries" , "computer", now I fell we are in the beginning of " the web era"
