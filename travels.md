My Favorite Vacation

My Favorite Vacation was the one I went to Europe for the first time a feel years ago, it was culturally very enriching.

I've learned so much about what the history books talks about, and got the feeling of the gigantic financial social differences that existed once in human life.

I was able to see different animals and plants, try new food and also experience some new adjustments of my body with the new virus and bacterias (not fun, but part of the whole learning experience)
